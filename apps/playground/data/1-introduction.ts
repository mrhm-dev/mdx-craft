# MDX-Craft

> Open-source MDX utility for rich, interactive markdown experiences.

<Space size="" />

## Open Source First

MDX-Craft is an **MIT-licensed** open-source project that democratizes access to professional documentation tools. We believe great documentation experiences shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or proprietary platforms.

Built by developers, for developers. No vendor lock-in, no licensing fees, just powerful tools at your fingertips.

## Why MDX-Craft?

MDX-Craft empowers developers to create documentation that users actually want to read. Whether you're building API documentation, technical blogs, or knowledge bases, you get professional results without complexity.

**Progressive enhancement** is at the core. Start with basic markdown and add interactive components as needed. Your content remains portable and version-controlled.

## What is MDX-Craft?

MDX-Craft transforms standard markdown into rich, interactive documentation. It bridges the gap between basic markdown processors and complex custom solutions, providing a comprehensive toolkit for building engaging content experiences.

<Tip title="Your Existing Tool Chain">
  Built on **MDX-js** with native **Tailwind v4** support, it seamlessly integrates with your React ecosystem such as **Shadcn** and **Next.js** while maintaining markdown's simplicity.

## The Challenge

Modern developers need more than basic markdown rendering. Current solutions fall short:

- **Tailwind Typography**: Limited to prose classes, lacks interactive components
- **Custom Solutions**: Time-consuming to build and maintain
- **Proprietary Platforms**: Expensive with vendor lock-in

MDX-Craft provides the missing piece: an open-source solution with enterprise features.
